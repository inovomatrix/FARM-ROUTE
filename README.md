# Farm Route (फार्म रूट)

### Smart Procurement & Queue Intelligence Platform

**Smart India Hackathon (SIH) Project**

---

## 1. Overview

**Farm Route** is a smart procurement and queue intelligence platform designed to eliminate long and uncertain waiting times at agricultural procurement centers, provide real-time visibility into center load and queue conditions, simplify procurement center selection, streamline slot booking, and ensure end-to-end transparency during procurement operations.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

- **Long and Uncertain Waiting Times**: Farmers face unpredictable and lengthy wait times at procurement centers during peak harvest seasons.
- **Limited Visibility into Center Load & Queue Conditions**: Farmers lack real-time visibility into procurement center queues, operational loads, and processing status before traveling.
- **Difficulty Choosing an Efficient Procurement Center**: Without centralized queue intelligence, farmers struggle to identify less congested or optimal nearby procurement centers.
- **Inefficient Slot and Queue Management**: Manual or uncoordinated queueing leads to bottlenecks, chaotic arrivals, and administrative delays.
- **Limited Transparency during Procurement Processing**: Lack of real-time status tracking creates uncertainty across verification, weighing, and receipt generation.

---

## 3. The Solution

Farm Route unifies Farmers, Procurement Center Operators, District Admins, and Super Admins on a streamlined platform:

- **Slot Booking**: Farmers schedule guaranteed time-slots matched against procurement center handling capacity.
- **Digital Token**: Automated, tamper-proof digital tokens providing seamless entry and live queue tracking.
- **Live Queue Intelligence**: Real-time visibility into procurement center load conditions (Low / Medium / High) and estimated wait times to help farmers choose optimal centers.
- **Procurement Tracking**: Transparent step-by-step tracking across gate check-in, moisture inspection, weighbridge recording, and receipt generation.
- **District Admin & Super Admin Oversight**: Centralized dashboards to monitor center throughput, queue velocity, and district-wide procurement quotas.

## 6. Current Development Phase

**Phase 1: Frontend Foundation & Design System (Completed)**

- [x] Gov-Tech & Agri-Intelligence design tokens (CSS custom properties for colors, typography, spacing).
- [x] Standardized component library (Buttons, Cards, Queue Badges, Form controls, Alerts).
- [x] ES6 JavaScript modular baseline (`mock-data.js`, `utils.js`, `api.js`).
- [x] Temporary foundation verification page (`index.html`).
- [x] Zero-dependency, zero-build setup for maximum portability and rapid competition iteration.

**Upcoming Milestones:**

- **Phase 2**: Public Landing Page with responsive navigation and platform highlights.
- **Phase 3**: Farmer Self-Service Portal (Center discovery, Slot Booking, Digital Token pass).
- **Phase 4**: Procurement Center Operator Desk & Live Queue Processing.
- **Phase 5**: District Admin & Super Admin Analytics Dashboard.
- **Phase 6**: FastAPI Backend Integration & Database Persistence.

## 7. Running the Frontend Foundation

Because this phase relies strictly on standard web technologies without heavyweight build tools, you can run the project immediately:

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (or use VS Code's **Live Server** extension).
3. The page will verify that the CSS design tokens, utility helpers, and mock API abstraction load cleanly.
